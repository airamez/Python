"""
In many situations it is necessary to execute the same block of command multiple times (repetition/looping)
Every programming language offer a few different ways to do looping.
The two most common ones are the "for" and "while" commands.
The "for" command is commonly used when we know up-front how many times we need to repeat the block of commands.
The "while" is commonly used when we can't predict how many the times the block of commands need to be repeated but we
know that in some point a condition will indicate when is time to finish the looping/repetition.
