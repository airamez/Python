Practices
---------
Write a program to:
01. Read the user name and print the message "Hello, USER_NAME"
02. Read two integer numbers in natural order and generate a random number between them.
    e.g.
     INPUT
       Number1 = 23
       Number2 = 45
     OUTPUT
       Random Number = 37
03. Read four numbers and calculate the average.
04. Read four numbers and calculates the weighted average using the weights 2, 2, 2, 4.
05. Read four numbers and print the numbers with the smallest value and largest value.
06. Read an temperature value in Fahrenheit and calculate it correspondent value in Celsius.
07. Read the two sides of a triangle and calculate the hypotenuse.
08. Read two integer numbers storing each one in a variable and switch the variable values.
09. Read the purchase price and desired profit percentage(%) for a product and calculate the sale price.
    e.g.
    INPUT
      Purchase Price = 500.00
      Desired Profit (%) = 30
    OUTPUT
      Sale Price = 650.00

10. Calculate how many minutes a client stayed in a store based on the time (Hour:Minutes) he arrived and the
    time (Hour:Minutes) he left.
    e.g
    INPUT
    Arrived at Hour = 8
    Arrived at Minutes = 15
    Left at Hour = 9
    Left at Minutes = 5
    OUTPUT
    Minutes in store = 50 minutes

11. Same as the previous question however calculating the time the client stayed in the story as hour:minutes
    INPUT
    Arrived at Hour = 8
    Arrived at Minutes = 15
    Left at Hour = 10
    Left at Minutes = 45
    OUTPUT
    Minutes in store = 2:30

12. Calculate how many dollar's bills of each one of the following values ($1, $5, $10, $20, $50) should be released
    in an ATM machine for a withdraw operation.
    The ATM machine should always give less dollar bills as possible
    e.g. INPUT
      Value = 1,338.00
    OUTPUT
      50 bills = 26
      20 bills = 1
      10 bills = 1
       5 bills = 1
       1 bills = 3

13. Read an integer number and indicate if the number is even or odd.
