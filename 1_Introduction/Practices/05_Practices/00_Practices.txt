Practices
---------
Write a program to:
01. Read an integer number and inform if the number is odd or even.
02. Read two integer numbers and inform if the numbers are equals or different.
03. Read a number and inform if the number is positive, negative or zero.
04. Read two integer numbers A and B and inform if A is divisible by B and if it is not divisible
    print the remainder.
05. Read two integer numbers and print them in ascending order.
06. Read a language code from the list below and print "Hello world" using the selected language
    en = English = "Hello world"
    pt = Portuguese = "Olá Mundo"
    sp = Spanish = "Holla Mundo"
    ch = Chinese = "你好，世界"
    ge = Germany = "Hallo Welt"
07. Read two integer numbers storing them into two Variables Number1 and Number2 and make sure that
    Number1 and Number2 variables get in ascending order.
08. Read three values and indicate if they can form a triangle.
09. Read three values and indicate if they can form a triangle and what type of triangle it would be:
    Equilateral, Isosceles, Scalene.
10. Generate and show two integers numbers between 0 and 99, ask the user to try the addition of both numbers
    and let the user know if the result is right.
    e.g
    3 + 7? = 11
    Wrong
11. Generate a basic random operation of addition, subtraction, multiplication or division using two number
    from 0 to 99 and challenge the user for the right answer.
    e.g
    34 x 12 = 408
    Congratulations, your answer is correct!
12. Read an integer number with 4 digits and generate another integer number with the inverted digits.
    e.g.
    Number = 1234
    Inverted = 4321
13. Read a time defined as Hour and Minutes where the Hour will be in military format (0 to 23) and print the time
    as conventional hour representation: Hour:Minutes AM/PM.
    e.g.
    Hour: 17
    Minutes: 45
    Conventional hour = 5:45 PM
14. Do the inverse of the previous questions.
    e.g.
    Hour: 3
    Minutes: 15
    Complemented: PM
    Military time = 15:15
15. Read the name, frequency (%) and the numbers of correct answers of a student and print his name and
    Grade based on the table below:
    0 to 10 questions = Grade D
    11 to 15 questions = Grade C
    16 to 20 questions = Grade B
    21 to 25 questions = Grade A
    Obs: If the student has less than 75% of frequency his Grade should be Failed.
16. Read the Name, employment length (Years) and the current salary of an employee and calculate the
    new salary base on the information below:
    Employment length	Salary increment
    0 to 2 years			1%
    3 to 4 years			2%
    5 to 10 years			3%
    above 10 years			5%

    Salary range	Salary increment
    0 to 45,000		    5%
    45,001 to 80,000	3%
    80,001 to 100,000	2%
    100,000 and above	1%
17. Read four integer numbers and print the ones divisible by 2 and 3.
18. Read three integer numbers and print them in ascending order.
19. Write a program to generate a random number between 0 and 100 and give the user 5 changes to guess
    the number end for every guess inform if the guessed number is smaller or greater than the generated number.
     As soon as the user guess the number correctly, stop the game and print a victory message.
20. Create a simple game to ask 5 questions to the user and show a summary with how many right answers the user had.
21. Read two intervals of integer numbers represented by four values
    (interval_1_min, interval_1_max, interval_2_min and interval_2_max) and indicate which of the following
    positions the interval 1 is related to the interval 2:
    ALL-LEFT     = All on the left
    LEFT-MIDDLE  = Starts on the left but ends in the middle
    ALL-MIDDLE   = Starts and ends inside the middle
    MIDDLE_RIGHT = Starts in the middle and ends on the right
    ALL-RIGHT    = All on the right
22. Read day, month and year for a date and indicate if the values represents a valida date.
