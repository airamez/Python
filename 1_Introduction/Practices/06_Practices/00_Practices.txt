Practices
---------
- Create a program to:
01. Print the numbers from 1 to 1000
02. Read two integer numbers representing an interval and print all numbers inside the interval
03. Read two integer numbers representing an interval and print all even numbers inside the interval
04. Read integer numbers (flag = 0) and print the average
05. Read integer numbers (flag = 0) and print the highest value
06. Read integer numbers (flag = 0) and print the smallest value and it's frequency
07. Print the first 20 terms of Fibonacci sequence (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ...)
08. Print the multiplication table for numbers from 0 to 9
    0 x 0 = 0
    0 x 1 = 0
    0 x 2 = 0
    ...
    0 x 9 = 0
    1 x 0 = 0
    1 x 1 = 1
    1 x 2 = 2
    ...
    1 x 9 = 9
    2 x 0 = 0
    2 x 1 = 2
    2 x 2 = 4
    ...
    9 x 9 = 81
09. Create a multiplication table game following the specification below:
    - The game must ask multiplication questions using random numbers from 0 to 9.
      e.g 3 x 9 = ?
          7 x 8 = ?
          0 x 2 = ?
          ...
    - The game should keep asking until the player get 3 wrong answers
    - At the end the game must print the score showing the number of right and wrong answers.
10. Read a integer number and calculate its Factorial. f(n) = n.(n-1).(n-2)(n-3)...1
    e.g
    f(0) = 1 (Exception)
    f(1) = 1
    f(4) = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 48
    f(6) = 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 720
11. Create a guessing game following the specification below:
    - Generate a random integer number from 1 to 100 (inclusive)
    - Let the user try to guess the number until it get the right number
    - For every guess the program should update the new interval
    - At the end print how many times the players guessed the number
    - e.g. Generated number = 35 (The player can't see this number)
      Try to guess a number from:
      1 to 100 => 20
      21 to 100 => 65
      21 to 64 => 30
      31 to 64 => 41
      31 to 40 => 36
      31 to 35 => 35
      Congratulations you guessed the right number with 6 attempts !
12. Read an integer number and reverse it's digits
    e.g
    Input = 12345
    Output = 54321
13. Read an integer number and determine if it is a prime number or not
14. Read two integer numbers and calculate the "integer" division without use the division operator
